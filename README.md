# gVisor Sandboxed Step

A GitHub Action that runs commands in a gVisor sandbox.

```yaml
- uses: geomys/sandboxed-step@v1.2.0
  with:
    run: |
      go get -u -t ./...
      go test ./...
```

## Motivation

Surprisingly enough, GitHub Actions with read-only permissions still receive a
cache write token, allowing [cache poisoning](https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/),
so they are not safe to run untrusted code. This has led to [supply chain
compromises](https://words.filippo.io/compromise-survey/).

Moreover, there is no isolation between steps in a workflow, since they all run
on the same VM with root access. The only alternative is separating workflows
with `workflow_run`, but that has its own limitations and overhead.

This can lead to a false sense of security when running untrusted code in a
workflow or step with read-only permissions (despite defaulting workflows to
read-only permissions being a top-level feature).

This Action runs commands in an isolated gVisor sandbox, allowing e.g. running
CI against the latest versions of dependencies without risking being affected by
supply chain attacks.

## Usage

The commands run in a gVisor sandbox with

  - a root filesystem similar to ubuntu-24.04 ([`ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:runner-24.04`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images))
  - overlayed access to GITHUB_WORKSPACE (changes do not persist by default)
  - GITHUB_WORKSPACE working directory
  - host network access
  - allow-listed environment variables
  - same user as the GitHub Actions runner, with sudo access
  - read-only access to tools installed by setup-* actions (via RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE)

Changes to the workspace inside the sandbox can be made to persist on the host
by setting `persist-workspace-changes: 'true'`. This is unlikely to be safe, as
following steps will need to treat the workspace as untrusted.

Alternatively, `persist-paths` lists workspace-relative paths (one per line)
whose changes persist on the host, while writes elsewhere are discarded. The
listed paths must still be treated as untrusted by following steps. Entries
that resolve outside the workspace (e.g. via symlinks) are rejected.

> [!NOTE]
> This action will detect and fail if the `actions/checkout` Action has
> persisted authentication tokens in GITHUB_WORKSPACE (the default behavior).
>
> To use this action, you must disable credential persistence in your checkout
> step:
>
> ```yaml
> - uses: actions/checkout@v4
>   with:
>     persist-credentials: false
> ```
>
> Alternatively, you can set `allow-checkout-credentials: true` to bypass this
> check, but this is **NOT RECOMMENDED** as it will expose the GitHub token to
> the sandbox.

All tags use GitHub's Immutable Releases, so they can't be changed even if this
repository is compromised.

### Inputs

- `run` (required): Commands to run in the sandbox
- `env` (optional): Additional environment variables to set in the sandbox (one per line, KEY=VALUE format)
- `persist-workspace-changes` (optional, default: `false`): Allow changes to persist on the host
- `persist-paths` (optional): Workspace-relative paths whose changes persist on the host (one per line)
- `disable-network` (optional, default: `false`): Disable network access in the sandbox
- `allow-checkout-credentials` (optional, default: `false`): Allow persisted checkout credentials
- `rootfs-image` (optional): Docker image to use as the root filesystem

### Example for sandboxed Go tests with latest dependencies

```yaml

          - { go-version-file: go.mod }
        deps:
          - locked
          - latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - uses: geomys/sandboxed-step@v1.1.1
        with:

              go get -u -t ./...
